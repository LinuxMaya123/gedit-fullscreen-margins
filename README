Fullscreen Margins plugin for Gedit
===================================

A plugin adds margins around text in fullscreen mode. This makes text centered
in a column with a width of around 80 characters. By avoiding too long lines,
it allows to turn Gedit into "distraction free editor".

Installation: Copy files fullscreen_margins.plugin and fullscreen_margins.py to
~/.local/share/gedit/plugins and enable plugin in Gedit preferences.
