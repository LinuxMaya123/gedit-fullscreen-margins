Fullscreen Margins plugin for Gedit
===================================

A plugin adds margins around text in fullscreen mode. This makes text centered
in a column with a width of around 80 characters. By avoiding too long lines,
it allows to turn Gedit into "distraction free editor".

This is a backport of the plugin for Gedit 2.

Installation: Copy files fullscreen_margins.gedit-plugin and
fullscreen_margins.py to ~/.gnome-2/gedit/plugins and enable
plugin in Gedit preferences.
